To update the Nyxt browser Lisp client to work with the new `github_issues.py`, you need to make sure that the Lisp client can call the Python script with the appropriate arguments (`--url`, `--title`, `--description`, and `--repo`). Since the requirement is to use the bare minimum dependencies and only use libraries bundled with Nyxt, the solution will focus on utilizing Nyxt's built-in functionalities for inter-process communication (IPC) and file handling.

Nyxt comes with support for Common Lisp's standard input/output functionalities and can execute shell commands, which is sufficient for our needs. The updated Nyxt Lisp client will create temporary files for the URL, title, and selected text, similar to the outdated version, but will directly call the updated `github_issues.py` script with these inputs.

Here's how you can update the `nyxt_browser-to-gh.lisp` script:

```lisp
(define-command-global gh-send-selection-to-issue
    nil
    "Sends URL, title, and selection to a new GitHub issue using github_issues.py"
    (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
           (myurl (url (current-buffer)))
           (selection
            (ps-eval
              (parenscript:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
           (repo "irthomasthomas/undecidability") ; Default repository, change as needed
           (python-script "/path/to/github_issues.py")) ; Update the path to your github_issues.py script
      (uiop:run-program (list "python3" python-script
                              "--url" myurl
                              "--title" title
                              "--description" selection
                              "--repo" repo)
                        :output t)))
```

This updated version of `nyxt_browser-to-gh.lisp` does the following:

1. It captures the current buffer's title, URL, and selected text.
2. It specifies a default GitHub repository to which the issue will be sent. You can modify the `repo` variable as needed.
3. It calls the `github_issues.py` script directly using `uiop:run-program`, passing the captured URL, title, selection, and repository as arguments. Note that you need to update the path to your `github_issues.py` script in the `python-script` variable.
4. The `:output t` option in `uiop:run-program` ensures that the output of the script (e.g., the URL of the created GitHub issue) is displayed to the user.

Make sure that the `github_issues.py` script is executable and that you have Python 3 installed on your system. You might also need to adjust the path to the Python executable (`python3`) depending on your system's configuration.

This solution leverages Nyxt's capability to execute external scripts and does not introduce additional dependencies beyond what's already available in Nyxt and a standard Python installation.
